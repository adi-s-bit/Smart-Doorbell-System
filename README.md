# Smart-Doorbell-System

Through this project, we are trying to achieve a simple, smart doorbell system. Since India is getting inclined towards online shopping and product deliveries, one of the problems that arise is when the product arrives at the doorstep, and no one is at home to receive it, or in day to day life also it can be considered to be providing a communication gap which sort of is solved by the smart doorbell. Through our doorbell, the owner will receive the notification at the exact moment when the bell rings on his smartphone.

The hardware implementation of our project can be viewed on the following link:
